Data professionals worldwide face the formidable task of handling substantial datasets, all in pursuit of extracting valuable insights for their organizations. Amidst the toolkit at their disposal, Google Sheets 📈 stands out, thanks to its user-friendly nature, accessibility, and collaborative capabilities. Yet, a persistent challenge has come to light: the laborious process of repeatedly importing CSV files into Google Sheets.

Picture a typical week for an analyst at an e-commerce enterprise, where they find themselves inundated with numerous CSV files 📁—each one holding a trove of information on sales, inventory, customer feedback, and more. These data files must be diligently scrutinized and organized for the company's weekly meetings. Regrettably, instead of diving directly into the analytical depths, most analysts find themselves investing an excessive amount of time in the mundane chore of importing and structuring these CSV files in Google Sheets. This recurrent, time-draining duty diminishes the efficiency of these professionals and obstructs the prompt discovery of vital insights.
